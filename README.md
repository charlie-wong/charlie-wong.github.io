hello-world
===========

let's get started with GitHub !

I do this @ 2014-09-15, Hunan University,Hunan,Changsha,China

This is the first branch from hello-world master-repository, just for fun!

It saves every commit file, and we can go back to any point through click commits of that time!

Every commit has associated with a commit-message, which tell why this commit is made!
